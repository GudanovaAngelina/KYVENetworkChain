## EventUpdateParams

EventUpdateParams is emitted when the parameters were changed by the governance.

```protobuf
message EventUpdateParams {
  // old_params is the module's old parameters.
  kyve.bundles.v1beta1.Params old_params = 1 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
  // new_params is the module's new parameters.
  kyve.bundles.v1beta1.Params new_params = 2 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
  // payload is the parameter updates that were performed.
  string payload = 3;
}
```

## EventBundleProposed

EventBundleProposed indicates that a new bundle proposal was submitted
to a storage pool. This event contains all information about the
proposal.

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

message EventBundleProposed {
    // pool_id is the unique ID of the pool.
    uint64 pool_id = 1;
    // internal id for the KYVE-bundle
    uint64 id = 2;
    // storage_id is the ID to retrieve to data item from the configured storage provider
    // e.g. the ARWEAVE-id
    string storage_id = 3;
    // Address of the uploader/proposer of the bundle
    string uploader = 4;
    // data_size size in bytes of the data
    uint64 data_size = 5;
    // from_index starting index of the bundle (inclusive)
    uint64 from_index = 6;
    // bundle_size amount of data items in the bundle
    uint64 bundle_size = 7;
    // from_key the key of the first data item in the bundle
    string from_key = 8;
    // to_key the key of the last data item in the bundle
    string to_key = 9;
    // bundle_summary is a short string holding some useful information of
    // the bundle which will get stored on-chain
    string bundle_summary = 10;
    // data_hash is a sha256 hash of the raw compressed data
    string data_hash = 11;
    // proposed_at the unix time when the bundle was proposed
    uint64 proposed_at = 12;
    // storage_provider_id the unique id of the storage provider where
    // the data of the bundle is tored
    uint32 storage_provider_id = 13;
    // compression_id  the unique id of the compression type the data
    // of the bundle was compressed with
    uint32 compression_id = 14;
}
```

  uint64 pool_id = 1;
  // internal id for the KYVE-bundle
  uint64 id = 2;
  // total voting power which voted for valid
  uint64 valid = 3;
  // total voting power which voted for invalid
  uint64 invalid = 4;
  // total voting power which voted for abstain
  uint64 abstain = 5;
  // total voting power of the pool
  uint64 total = 6;
  // vestingStatus of the finalized bundle

  // rewards transferred to treasury (in ukyve)
  uint64 reward_treasury = 8;
  // rewardUploader rewards directly transferred to uploader (in ukyve)
